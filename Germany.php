            <p>
                Love black forest cake? Then you will love Germany, the birthplace of this fluffy delicacy!On a more serious note, 
                Germany is an economic superpower that has become a very attractive place for students all over the world to pursue their studies, 
                and ranks right after the United States and the United Kingdom in that respect. Many German universities are in the top 100 world rankings,
                having both tradition and excellence in teaching. German universities celebrate their acclaimed students,
                several of whom are great scientists and Nobel laureates; so there isn’t a doubt that you will receive extraordinary education.
                Studying in Germany will ensure that there is no shortage of student clubs and activities, both on and off campus
                With your student ID, you can receive concessions on tickets and entrance fees to theatres, opera houses, cinemas, museums,
                public swimming pools and other cultural venues. Be sure to address the elderly with “Sie,”
                which is the formal “you” to show respect and remember to address your professors by their last name.
                Germans value punctuality greatly, so ensure to be in time. Germans are assumed to be reserved and that is somewhat true
                of smaller towns and villages. But in larger cities and places with a lot of young people, this myth will get busted.
                The icing on the cake to all that Germany has to offer is the world famous Oktoberfest – a festival celebrating beer,
                its many brews and amazing German music!
