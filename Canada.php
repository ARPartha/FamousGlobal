              <p>In the current economic environment, Canada provides maximum employment opportunities to skilled immigrants.
                  Canadian Visa regulations are also favorable towards post-study employment, for Indian students as well as their dependents
                  . A work permit under the Post-Graduation Work Permit Program (PGWPP) is necessary to work in Canada after you graduate.
                   There are a number of programs available to even stay in Canada as a permanent resident after graduation, each with its own requirements.
                 </p>
                 <p>A work permit under the PGWPP is often issued for the length of the study program, up to a maximum of three years. 
                     A post-graduation work permit cannot be valid for longer than the student’s study program, and the study program must be a
                      minimum of eight months in length. For example, if you graduate from a two-year degree program, you could be eligible for a two-year 
                      work permit if you meet the criteria.
                      To determine your eligibility and apply, contact your AEC counsellor.</p>
