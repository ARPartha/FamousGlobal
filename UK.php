            <h2 style="color:blue">LIFE IN UK</h2>
            <p>
                Culturally, the UK is very diverse due to its proximity to Europe. Larger cities such as London attract people from all over the globe, 
                reflecting this dynamic nature in language, cuisine, practices and culture. People in the UK are welcoming of people from around the world. 
                You should be able to find many like-minded students as most universities have different societies dedicated to different nationalities, 
                sports, arts and niche interests. As an international student, you will be entitled to free or reduced healthcare under the National Health 
                Service (NHS) while you are in the UK.British people respect and follow punctuality, 
                so leave your Indian-stretchable-time practices back at home. Be cautious to use ‘Thank You’ and ‘Sorry’ generously 
                as people love to be polite and gentle, epitomizing the gentlemanly and lady-like behavior that the British are famous for. 
                Another important aspect to note is the British obsession with weather, which is cold, wet and often grey! So don’t be surprised 
                if someone begins a conversation saying, ‘How’s the weather today?’ or if you find people being cheerful on a Sunny day. In all, 
                the UK is a great place to get affiliated with famed British practices, remarkably rich Irish and Sottish whiskeys and their robust culture.

                <p>
                International students from outside the EU, are allowed to work while studying if they study at a university
                or college that is listed on both the official UKVI Sponsor list and the list of ‘recognized bodies’. However, 
                The rules state that applicants must be able to support themselves and any dependents without working in the UK. 
                This means that while there is provision for students to take employment during vacations or spare time, no account may 
                be taken of any prospective earnings from that employment in assessing the ability of a student to meet the maintenance 
                requirement, except where the educational establishment at which the student has a place. Tier 4 students with work rights 
                will be prevented from setting up businesses in the UK, including where they are not the controlling shareholder.
                As of July 2015, new students at publicly funded colleges in the UK will not be permitted to seek student employment.
